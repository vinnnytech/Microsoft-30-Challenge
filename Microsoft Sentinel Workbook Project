# 📊 Explicit Credential Logons (Event ID 4648) — Microsoft Sentinel Workbook Project

This project showcases how I used **Microsoft Sentinel Workbooks** and **Kusto Query Language (KQL)** to detect and visualize **Explicit Credential Logons (Event ID 4648)**.  

Event ID **4648** is triggered when a process attempts to log on using **explicit credentials**, which is often seen in:

- Lateral movement  
- Credential theft  
- Privilege escalation  
- Use of alternate or compromised accounts
