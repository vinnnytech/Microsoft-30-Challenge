# Microsoft-30-Challenge


🚀 #Objective

The goal of this 30-Day MyDFIR Microsoft SOC Analyst Challenge is to build hands-on skills in a modern, cloud-focused Security Operations Center (SOC) environment. Throughout the challenge, I will design and deploy a full Microsoft security lab, investigate real-world threats, and practice the workflows used by professional SOC analysts. This project showcases my ability to detect, analyze, and respond to cyber threats using Microsoft Sentinel, Defender for Endpoint, Defender for Office 365, and Entra ID—while documenting my findings through threat hunts, detections, and MITRE-mapped incident reports.

By the end of this challenge, I will have practical experience with:
  
•	Building a Microsoft-based SOC lab from scratch

•	Deploying and configuring Microsoft Sentinel, Defender for Endpoint, Defender for Office 365, and Entra ID

•	Investigating phishing, malware, and identity-based attacks

•	Performing threat hunting and detection analysis

•	Writing incident reports mapped to the MITRE ATT&CK Framework

•	Following real SOC workflows for alert triage, escalation, and remediation

•	Documenting and showcasing my work for community review and portfolio development
